<h1>My top linux distros</h1>
<p>Because Linux, the kernel and applications are opensource, there are many versions, or "distributions” of Linux and so these are my favorite ones and ones would recommend for either a beginner to the Linux operating system or someone willing to switch a distribution or even a pro!</p>
</div>

<div class="mobile paragraph">
<ol>
    <li>
        <h2><a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian</a></h2>
        <p>Its stable, like most of the applications have a rare chance of crashing or there are less bugs because most things get fixed though security updates. And it is what ubuntu is based off. I’ve used Debian on 2 old machines that are 10 years old and they feel more new than on windows 10. The downside is that drivers(the things that makes the computer talk to the hardware) are a pain to install, especially the Wi-Fi drivers or that Debian stable, what makes Debian so stable, ends up with a bunch of stale software that isn’t old to be obsolete but isn’t the newest software.</p>
    </li>
    

    <li>
        <h2><a href="https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/" target="_blank">OpenSUSE Tumbleweed</a></h2>
        <p>If a current windows user is a developer and needs the newest applications and the latest and greatest software. OpenSUSE is a great option as it’s very snappy and comes out with the newest applications like Arch Linux® (another distribution of Linux® that’s more in tuned to Sysadmins, and “Power Users”) but isn’t as unstable as Arch Linux®. Plus, it integrates the KDE plasma Desktop environment-the look and feel of a distribution that comes with a set up Application and is one of the first to get KDE features. Plus there’s a tool called YAst that acts like the windows control panel so windows users can get more intune with linux when switching from windows.</p>
    </li>


    <li>
        <h2><a href="https://getfedora.org/" target="_blank">Fedora</a></h2>
        <p>A bit more stable than openSUSE Tumbleweed but is still a good distribution because the fedora development team are the ones who introduce new innovative standards to Linux® like having one of the first ones to integrate systemd when systemd-an init system, came out. Or Wayland, a new default display manager -a server that displays the actual windows of an application, as the default display manager. And its backed and used by Redhat, a business enterprise company that makes Redhat Linux® and gives support to Redhat Linux®. It doesn’t beat openSUSE because I Find Fedora Linux® full of software that is unnecessary for my needs, and it is limited to as what you can remove.</p>
    </li>


    <li>
        <h2><a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a></h2>
        <p>Linux mint is a good option as it was my second distribution of Linux® and I used it on some old hardware, they don’t have snaps packages as the default when downloading software but it’s based on Ubuntu and so it depends on Ubuntu servers, it’s a great alternative to Ubuntu because while Ubuntu is a good distribution, Linux® mint is a good alternative and i recomend it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h2><a href="https://kubuntu.org/" target="_blank">Kubuntu</a></h2>
        <p>Kubuntu is a Ubuntu fork that uses the KDE plasma desktop environment as a desktop environment for Ubuntu and Ubuntu uses the gnome desktop environment by default. It was the first distribution that I used in Linux®, the one that made me like Linux® but it is basically Ubuntu but with KDE and after learning about Linux® from classes and from google and friends. That in my opinion there are better alternatives than to Ubuntu.</p>

        <h3><a href="" target="_blank">Arduino Music application</a></h3>
        <p>Made on December 6 2022</p>
        <p>The "Arduino Music application" project is an Arduino that sings two old rock songs that are part of my jukebox application final for my C# class. When the jukebox application selects the two songs, it will display the lyrics like with other songs, but it will send a signal to the Arduino to play the chorus of the songs on a buzzer.</p>

<h3>Jukebox</h3>
<p>Made on weeks of November 15-December 5 2022</p>
<p>My final project for my beginning C# class in the fall where my Professor assigned two options for the final, one is to build a application like the example shown on the assignment or another option is to make your own application for the final but it had to fulfill some requirements. I choose the second option because I wanted to make a jukebox application where it would read music lyrics files from a computer and display them, as well as show the progress of the music being played. I also added a function that if a song like Dr.Feelgood by Motley Crue where to play, the Arduino will play the song, by using buzzers.</p>

    <h3>Tic-Tak-Toe</h3>
    <p>Made on November 9, 2022</p>
    <p>Tic-tac-toe was an application where the computer would “play” against it’s self by assigning random numbers to an array by using the random class. Basically to win, the computer would place X in a row or O in a row and then X wins or O wins. It was part of some exercises from my textbook starting out with c# by Tonny Gaddis.</p>

        <p>Made on June 28 2022</p>
        <p>Motif window manager was a window manager that was used back in the 80s during the Unix time when it was used but is still revelont in modern servers, I wanted a window manager where if I do decide to make a Linux® server than I would use motif because it is light on resources. The theme here is a cool galaxy theme of my favorite colors, blue and green.</p>

    <h3>Tron:Legacy Theme bspwm</h3>
    <p>Made on march 2022</p>
    <p>Bspwm is a window manager which means that it’s just an application that displays windows, while a desktop environment Has a window manager and extra utilities. What I made here is bspwm that is Tron: legacy themed because the movie was really fascinating to me and at the time I really liked it and so I decided to spin up Arch Linux® and make a theme about. it</p>
