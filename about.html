    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>My name is Matthew Amorelli and I am someone who is aspiring in the computer science field, I'm not sure exactly what I want to do because programming is a good carrer but I also would like to be a system administrator, like working on Linux® systems. As of now I am studying at <span><a href="https://www.tmcc.edu/" target="_blank">Truckee Meadows Community College(TMCC)</a></spam> for computer programming and I plan to transfer to <span><a href="https://www.unr.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Nevada(UNR)</a></spam> in 2023 for a bachlors in Computer-Science.</p>

        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>Some of the hobbies I like to do, other than studying for college courses are that I like to learn and mess around a nice “little” operating system called Linux® that powers a lot of computers, typically servers but it works as a desktop operating system too. Its fun to learn about and tinker with because it gives you so much power on what it can do…so much so that a user can delete Linux® from there computer. Other than Linux® I enjoy listening to a lot of glam hard rock music as quite often someone can find me when programming listening to KISS or more recently Van Halen. I also enjoy camping during the summer with my dad and my favorite spot is Lahontan Reservoir located near Silver Springs nevada. And I also like to play some video games and play a few titles…like 3. But school work is a priority.</p>
